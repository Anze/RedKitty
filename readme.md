This is the Redis Web Client with no dependencies. Including interactive console with history to see how things going.

### Installation ###

Point web directory to /www and you are set. Other options placed at config.php.

WARNING: This project made for standalone domain, but it uses additional prefix in url: /kitty.

I don`t know what i was thinking about at that time, sorry about that. Also no config for nginx.

### Dependencies ###

Tested on PHP 5.2+ and 7.0+.

Writed for Redis 2.x. May have not fully supported functional for latest Redis releases.
